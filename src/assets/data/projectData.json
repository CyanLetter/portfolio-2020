Visitors who walked through the center of the room were rewarded with the chance to fling ribbons of text across the gallery walls, streams of text acting as extensions of their hands. When idle, the blue text crawling slowly along the wall added colorful amience to the dim gallery.",

That included typical Unity scripting, interfacing with the Kinect SDK, building the Unity scene, and making some on-the-fly changes during installation. It was the first time I have had to write code while upside-down on a ladder, and hopefully the last."
